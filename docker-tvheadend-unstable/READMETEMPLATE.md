The [LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io) team brings you another container release featuring auto-update on startup, easy user mapping and community support. Find us for support at:
* [forum.linuxserver.io](https://forum.linuxserver.io)
* [IRC](https://www.linuxserver.io/index.php/irc/) on freenode at `#linuxserver.io`
* [Podcast](https://www.linuxserver.io/index.php/category/podcast/) covers everything to do with getting the most from your Linux Server plus a focus on all things Docker and containerisation!

# linuxserver/<container-name>

Provide a short, concise description of the application. No more than two SHORT paragraphs. Link to sources where possible and include an image illustrating your point if necessary. Point users to the original applications website, as that's the best place to get support - not here.

Our Plex container has immaculate docs so follow that if in doubt for layout.

## Usage

```
docker create \
  --name=<container-name> \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid>  \
  -p 1234:1234 \
  linuxserver/<container-name>
```

**Parameters**

* `-p 1234` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - explain what lives here
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f container-name`

## Versions

+ **dd.MM.yyyy:** This is the standard Version type now.
